# ⚙️ Dotfiles

Bootstrapping process and installation is heavily inspired by [@rafaelyeng's dotfiles](https://github.com/rafaeleyng/dotfiles/), which are in turn inspired by [@holman's dotifles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) (recursion :yay:).
Configuration tweaks, aliases and functions are gathered from various sources with my own modifications on top.
